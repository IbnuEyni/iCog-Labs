**Description:** Explored the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, focusing on methods to enhance natural language processing models with information retrieval techniques to generate accurate responses.

**Skills Gained:** NLP, Retrieval-based Modeling, Data Augmentation

---

### 2. Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Advanced-RAG)
**Description:** Built upon the RAG foundation to tackle complex data retrieval tasks. Advanced training covered optimizing retrieval pipelines and handling large datasets for enhanced response accuracy.

**Skills Gained:** Advanced Retrieval Techniques, Optimization, Large-scale Data Processing

---

### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms: Graphs (DSA Graph)
**Description:** Completed in-depth training on graph algorithms, focusing on traversal, shortest paths, and graph-based problem-solving essential for graph databases and recommendation systems.

**Skills Gained:** Graph Theory, Traversal Algorithms, Pathfinding

---

### 4. Genetic Algorithms
**Description:** Studied the principles of genetic algorithms, including population-based search, mutation, and crossover, to solve optimization problems.

**Skills Gained:** Evolutionary Algorithms, Optimization Techniques, Heuristics

---

### 5. Search Engine Development
**Description:** Gained hands-on experience in building a basic search engine, implementing core functionalities like indexing, querying, and ranking.

**Skills Gained:** Search Indexing, Query Parsing, Ranking Algorithms

---

### 6. Full-Stack JWT Authentication
**Description:** Developed a full-stack application with JWT-based authentication for secure, stateless user sessions. The project included both frontend and backend integration.

**Skills Gained:** JWT, Authentication Protocols, Full-Stack Development

---

### 7. Neo4j Movie Recommendation System
**Description:** Built a movie recommendation system leveraging Neo4jâ€™s graph database to suggest movies based on user preferences and similarity to other movies.

**Skills Gained:** Neo4j, Recommendation Algorithms, Cypher Query Language

---

## Work Projects

### 1. Neo4j Resume Graph
**Description:** Developed a Neo4j graph model to organize and visualize resume data, making it easy to query skills, experiences, and connections within a professional network.

**Contributions:** Graph Schema Design, Query Optimization, Data Visualization

---

### 2. Neo4j Social Media Graph
**Description:** Created a Neo4j-based social media graph, modeling relationships and interactions between users. This enabled complex querying for social insights.

**Contributions:** Graph Modeling, Relationship Management, Social Network Analysis

---

### 3. LangChain Graph QA Chatbot
**Description:** Built a chatbot using LangChain and Neo4j to perform question-answering on graph data. This bot could answer queries based on structured graph data.

**Contributions:** LangChain Integration, QA Functionality, Graph Data Interaction

---

### 4. Movie Graph Chatbot
**Description:** Developed a chatbot for querying movie-related data from a Neo4j graph database. The bot provides users with movie recommendations and details based on their queries.

**Contributions:** Chatbot Development, Movie Recommendation Integration, User Interaction Design

---

### 5. Generalized Graph Chatbot
**Description:** Extended the chatbot project to a more generalized form capable of answering queries on any type of graph data, allowing for versatile, domain-independent question-answering.

**Contributions:** Generalization of QA Logic, Dynamic Query Handling, Flexibility Across Domains

---

### 6. Auto-Suggestion in Annotation Query
**Description:** Implemented an auto-suggestion feature for annotation queries, improving user experience by providing real-time suggestions based on partial input.

**Contributions:** Auto-Suggestion Algorithm, Real-Time Query Processing, User Experience Optimization
